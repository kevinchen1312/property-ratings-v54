```

### Environment Variables

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Database Setup

Ensure your Supabase database has the proper schema:

```sql
-- Run the property-ratings-migration-final.sql first
-- Then run database-optimization.sql for performance
```

## 🎮 Usage

### Option 1: Master Controller (Recommended)

The master controller orchestrates the entire operation with parallel processing:

```bash
# Start the complete USA import system
npx ts-node scripts/masterImportController.ts
```

Features:

### Option 2: Individual Systems

Run specific components independently:

```bash
# Complete grid-based import
npx ts-node scripts/importUSAComplete.ts

# County-by-county import
npx ts-node scripts/importUSAByCounty.ts

# Gap detection and analysis
npx ts-node scripts/gapDetectionSystem.ts
```

### Option 3: Existing Regional Scripts

Continue using your existing scripts for specific areas:

```bash
# Santa Clara County (already implemented)
npx ts-node scripts/importSantaClaraCounty.ts

# Complete county coverage
npx ts-node scripts/completeCountyCoverage.ts
```
