# ðŸ’° Quick Start: Rater Payouts with Stripe Express

## TL;DR - What You Need to Do

Your app **already has** a fully functional earnings system! Just need to deploy it:

```bash
# 1. Run database migrations in Supabase SQL Editor
revenue-sharing-schema-safe.sql
stripe-connect-migration-safe.sql

# 2. Deploy edge functions
npx supabase functions deploy createStripeConnectAccount
npx supabase functions deploy processPayouts

# 3. Add Stripe keys to Supabase secrets (Dashboard â†’ Edge Functions â†’ Secrets)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
```

Done! ðŸŽ‰

## How It Works (User Perspective)

### For Raters:

1. **Rate properties** â†’ System tracks contributions
2. **Someone buys a report** â†’ Rater earns money automatically
3. **Connect bank account** â†’ One-time Stripe Express setup (2 min)
4. **Request payout** â†’ Money transferred to bank account

### Revenue Split:
- **80%** Platform (you)
- **10%** Top contributor (most ratings for that property)
- **10%** Other contributors (split proportionally)

## Example Flow

1. **Alice rates 15 properties**
2. **Bob buys report for $10**
3. **System calculates:**
   - Platform: $8.00
   - Alice: $1.00 (top contributor)
   - Other raters: $1.00 (split)
4. **Alice sees $1.00 in Earnings screen**
5. **Alice clicks "Request Payout"**
6. **$1.00 transferred to Alice's bank account**

## Cost Structure

### Stripe Fees:
- **Transfers:** $0.25 per transfer (flat fee)
- **Express accounts:** FREE for you (Stripe charges the rater)
- **Instant payouts:** Optional $0.50 + 1% (vs free 2-day standard)

### Example:
- Alice earns $10 â†’ Pays $0.25 fee â†’ Receives $9.75
- Still better than PayPal ($0.30 + 2.9% = $0.59 fee)
