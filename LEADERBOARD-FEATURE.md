# üèÜ Property Leaderboard Feature

## What Was Added

A leaderboard feature that shows top contributors for each property, accessible from the rating modal with a flip animation effect.

## How It Works

### Toggle Button
- **Location**: In the property rating modal header (top-right, next to the close button)
- **Icon**: 
  - üèÜ (trophy) - Shows when in rating view, tap to see leaderboard
  - üìù (notepad) - Shows when in leaderboard view, tap to go back to rating

### Leaderboard Display

#### When There Are Ratings:
- **Header**: Shows property name and total contributor count
- **Ranking**: Users sorted by number of ratings (most to least)
- **Special Styling** for top 3:
  - ü•á **1st Place**: Gold background with gold border
  - ü•à **2nd Place**: Silver background with silver border
  - ü•â **3rd Place**: Bronze background with bronze border
  - Others: Show rank number (#4, #5, etc.)
- **User Info**: Full name and rating count for each contributor

#### When No Ratings Yet:
- Empty state with trophy emoji
- "No Ratings Yet" message
- "Be the first to rate this property!" encouragement

### Data Loading
- Data is fetched from Supabase when you tap the trophy icon
- Loading spinner shown while fetching
- Error handling with alert if fetch fails

## Technical Details

### Database Query
Queries the `rating` table joined with `app_user` to get:
- User IDs
- Full names
- Rating counts per user

### Files Modified

1. **`src/screens/MapScreen.tsx`**
   - Added leaderboard state variables
   - Added `fetchLeaderboard` function to query database
   - Added `toggleLeaderboard` function to switch views
   - Updated modal header with leaderboard button
   - Added conditional rendering for rating form vs leaderboard
   - Added leaderboard UI with ranking, styling, and empty states
   - Added comprehensive styles for all leaderboard elements

### Features

- **Real-time data**: Fetches fresh data each time you view the leaderboard
- **Sorted ranking**: Automatically ranks users by contribution count
- **Visual hierarchy**: Top 3 contributors get special medal emojis and colors
- **Smooth transition**: Instant flip between rating and leaderboard views
- **Responsive**: Works with any number of contributors
- **Error handling**: Gracefully handles fetch errors

## User Experience Flow

1. User clicks on a property pin
2. Rating modal opens showing rating form
3. User taps üèÜ button in top-right
4. Modal title changes to "Leaderboard"
5. Loading spinner appears briefly
6. Leaderboard shows with:
   - Top contributors ranked
   - Medal emojis for top 3
   - Special background colors for top 3
   - Full names and rating counts
7. User taps üìù button to return to rating form
8. Modal flips back to "Rate Property" view

## Design Highlights

- **Gold (#FFD700)**: 1st place border and background tint
- **Silver (#C0C0C0)**: 2nd place border and light gray background
- **Bronze (#CD7F32)**: 3rd place border and light orange background
- **Clean cards**: Rounded corners, proper spacing
- **Large emoji ranks**: Easy to see at a glance
- **Consistent styling**: Matches app's blue (#007AFF) theme

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Open property modal with no ratings - see empty state
- [ ] Open property modal with 1 rating - see single entry with ü•á
- [ ] Open property modal with 3+ ratings - see medals for top 3
- [ ] Verify sorting (highest count at top)
- [ ] Test toggling between rating and leaderboard views
- [ ] Verify loading spinner shows briefly
- [ ] Verify user full names display correctly
- [ ] Verify rating counts are accurate
- [ ] Test on properties with many contributors (scrolling)
- [ ] Test error handling (airplane mode)
