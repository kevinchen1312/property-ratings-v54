# üöÄ Switch to LIVE Stripe Mode - Step by Step

## Overview
You're currently in **demo mode**. This guide will help you switch to **real Stripe payouts**.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Get Live Stripe API Keys

### 1.1 Go to Stripe Dashboard
Visit: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys

### 1.2 Toggle to LIVE Mode
- Look for the toggle in the top-left corner
- Switch from **"Test mode"** to **"Live mode"**

### 1.3 Get Your Live Keys
You'll need:
- **Secret key**: Starts with `sk_live_...`
- **Publishable key**: Starts with `pk_live_...` (optional for now)

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Keep these keys secret! Don't commit them to git.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Create Live Webhooks

### 2.1 Go to Webhooks Section
Visit: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks

Make sure you're in **LIVE mode** (check the toggle).

### 2.2 Create Connect Webhook

Click **"Add endpoint"** and configure:

**Endpoint URL:**
```
https://YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripeConnectWebhook
```

**Description:**
```
Stripe Connect account events (LIVE)
```

**Events to send:**
- ‚úÖ `account.updated`
- ‚úÖ `account.application.authorized`
- ‚úÖ `account.application.deauthorized`
- ‚úÖ `account.external_account.created`
- ‚úÖ `account.external_account.updated`
- ‚úÖ `account.external_account.deleted`
- ‚úÖ `capability.updated`

**API version:** Use the latest (or 2023-10-16)

Click **"Add endpoint"**

### 2.3 Copy the Webhook Signing Secret
- After creating, click on the webhook
- Click **"Reveal"** next to "Signing secret"
- Copy it (starts with `whsec_`)
- Save it for Step 3

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Update Supabase Environment Variables

### 3.1 Go to Supabase Dashboard
Visit: https://app.supabase.com/project/YOUR_PROJECT/settings/functions

### 3.2 Update These Secrets

Click on each secret and update with your LIVE values:

**STRIPE_SECRET_KEY**
```
sk_live_your_live_secret_key_here
```

**STRIPE_CONNECT_WEBHOOK_SECRET**
```
whsec_your_live_webhook_secret_here
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: After updating, you need to redeploy your functions!

### 3.3 Redeploy Edge Functions

Open PowerShell in your project directory and run:

```powershell
# Deploy the payout processing function
npx supabase functions deploy processPayouts

# Deploy the Connect webhook handler
npx supabase functions deploy stripeConnectWebhook

# Deploy the Connect account creation function
npx supabase functions deploy createStripeConnectAccount
```

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Clean Up Demo Accounts

### 4.1 Run the Cleanup Script

I've created a SQL script for you: `clean-demo-accounts.sql`

Run it in Supabase SQL Editor:
1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/YOUR_PROJECT/sql
2. Open `clean-demo-accounts.sql`
3. Click **"Run"**

This will:
- Remove demo Stripe accounts from your database
- Keep all other user data intact
- Allow users to create real Stripe accounts

---

## ‚úÖ Step 5: Enable Stripe Connect (If Not Already)

Visit: https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect

### 5.2 Configure Platform
- **Platform name**: `Leadsong Property Ratings`
- **Platform URL**: Your production URL
- **Support email**: Your support email

### 5.3 Enable Express Accounts
Make sure **Express accounts** are enabled (they should be by default).

## ‚úÖ Step 6: Test with Real Account

### 6.1 In Your App
1. Open the Earnings screen
2. Click **"üîó Stripe Connection"**

### 6.3 Verification

## ‚úÖ Step 7: Test Real Payout

### 7.1 Create Test Earnings

1. Rate some properties
2. Have someone purchase a report (or test purchase)
3. Earnings will appear in your Earnings screen
