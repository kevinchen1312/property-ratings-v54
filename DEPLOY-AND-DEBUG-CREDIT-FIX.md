# Deploy and Debug Credit Sync Fix - Step by Step

## Current Status
Credits are not updating after purchase. The webhook is firing (you can see events in Stripe), but credits aren't being added to your account.

## Step-by-Step Fix

### STEP 1: Check Current State

First, let's see what's happening:

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
-- File: investigate-current-issue.sql

-- Copy and paste the entire investigate-current-issue.sql file
```

This will tell us:
- ‚úÖ If the database function was updated
- ‚úÖ What the status of your recent purchase is
- ‚úÖ If there are any errors

### STEP 2: Deploy the Database Fix

**CRITICAL: This MUST be done first**

1. Open Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Copy the contents of `fix-credit-sync-issue.sql`
3. Click "Run"
4. You should see: "CREATE FUNCTION" messages

Verify it worked:
```sql
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN prosrc LIKE '%retry_count%' THEN '‚úÖ NEW VERSION'
        ELSE '‚ùå OLD VERSION - FIX NOT DEPLOYED'
    END as status
FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname = 'complete_credit_purchase';
```

### STEP 3: Deploy the Webhook Fix

The webhook function also needs to be updated.

**Option A: Deploy via Supabase CLI** (recommended)
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\ucric\leadsong v2.5\property-ratings-v54"
npx supabase functions deploy stripeWebhook
```

**Option B: Manual via Dashboard**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Edge Functions
2. Click on `stripeWebhook`
3. Copy the contents of `supabase/functions/stripeWebhook/index.ts`
4. Paste and deploy

### STEP 4: Verify Webhook Deployment

Check the webhook logs:
1. Make a test purchase
2. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí stripeWebhook ‚Üí Logs
3. Look for these new emoji logs:
   - üõí Processing credit purchase
   - ‚úÖ Successfully added credits
   - OR ‚ùå Failed (with detailed error)

### STEP 5: Test the Fix

1. **Make a small test purchase** ($5 starter pack)
2. **Immediately check the database**:
   ```sql
   -- Run this RIGHT AFTER purchase
   SELECT 
       status,
       credits,
       stripe_session_id,
       created_at,
       metadata
   FROM credit_purchase
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

3. **Check if credits were added**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM user_credits WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Function Not Updated

**Symptom**: Step 2 verification shows "‚ùå OLD VERSION"

**Solution**: 
```sql
-- Run fix-credit-sync-issue.sql again
-- Make sure you see "CREATE FUNCTION" in the output
```

### Issue 2: Webhook Still Returns 200 on Error

**Symptom**: Stripe shows HTTP 200 but credits not added

**Solution**: Webhook wasn't deployed. Redo Step 3.

### Issue 3: "Purchase not found" Error

**Symptom**: Webhook logs show "Purchase not found"

**Solution**: The stripe_session_id might not be saved to credit_purchase

```sql
-- Check if stripe_session_id is being saved
SELECT id, stripe_session_id, created_at
FROM credit_purchase
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- If stripe_session_id is NULL, there's an issue in createCreditCheckout
```

### Issue 4: RLS Policy Blocking

**Symptom**: "permission denied" or "insufficient privileges"

**Solution**:
```sql
-- Check RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'user_credits';

-- The function uses SECURITY DEFINER so it should bypass RLS
-- But let's verify the user_credits table allows inserts
```

### Issue 5: Credits Still Pending

**Symptom**: Purchase shows status='pending' after several minutes

**Solution**: Either webhook didn't fire OR there's an error

1. **Check Stripe webhook logs**:
   - Go to Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Webhooks
   - Click on your webhook endpoint
   - Look for recent `checkout.session.completed` events
   - Check HTTP response code

2. **Manually trigger the function**:
   ```sql
   -- Get the session ID
   SELECT stripe_session_id FROM credit_purchase 
   WHERE status='pending' 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
   
   -- Manually complete it
   SELECT complete_credit_purchase('cs_test_...');
   
   -- Check if it worked
   SELECT * FROM user_credits WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
   ```

### Issue 6: Multiple Failed Purchases

**Symptom**: Multiple purchases show status='failed'

**Solution**: Retry them all
```sql
-- Retry all failed purchases
DO $$
DECLARE
  failed_purchase RECORD;
  retry_result BOOLEAN;
BEGIN
  FOR failed_purchase IN 
    SELECT stripe_session_id 
    FROM credit_purchase 
    WHERE status = 'failed'
    ORDER BY created_at
  LOOP
    BEGIN
      SELECT retry_failed_credit_purchase(failed_purchase.stripe_session_id) INTO retry_result;
      RAISE NOTICE 'Retried %: %', failed_purchase.stripe_session_id, retry_result;
    EXCEPTION
      WHEN OTHERS THEN
        RAISE WARNING 'Failed to retry %: %', failed_purchase.stripe_session_id, SQLERRM;
    END;
  END LOOP;
END $$;
```

## Quick Test After Deployment

Run this complete test:

```sql
-- 1. Verify function is updated
SELECT 'Function Version:' as check, 
    CASE 
        WHEN prosrc LIKE '%retry_count%' THEN '‚úÖ NEW VERSION'
        ELSE '‚ùå OLD VERSION'
    END as result
FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'complete_credit_purchase'

UNION ALL

-- 2. Check recent purchases
SELECT 'Recent Purchases:' as check, 
    COUNT(*)::text || ' purchases in last hour' as result
FROM credit_purchase 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'

UNION ALL

-- 3. Check failed purchases
SELECT 'Failed Purchases:' as check,
    COUNT(*)::text || ' failed (need retry)' as result
FROM credit_purchase 
WHERE status = 'failed'

UNION ALL

-- 4. Check your credits
SELECT 'Your Credits:' as check,
    COALESCE(credits, 0)::text || ' credits' as result
FROM user_credits 
WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
```

## Expected Results After Fix

### Successful Purchase Flow

1. **Stripe Event**: `checkout.session.completed` fires
2. **Webhook Logs**: Shows üõí Processing credit purchase
3. **Database**: `credit_purchase.status` changes from 'pending' to 'completed'
4. **Credits**: `user_credits.credits` increases
5. **Webhook Response**: HTTP 200 with success message
6. **App**: Credits show in UI immediately (after refresh)

### Failed Purchase Flow (with retry)

1. **Stripe Event**: `checkout.session.completed` fires
2. **Webhook Logs**: Shows ‚ùå Failed with error details
3. **Database**: `credit_purchase.status` stays 'pending', metadata shows retry_count
4. **Webhook Response**: HTTP 500 (tells Stripe to retry)
5. **Stripe Retry**: Tries again in 1 minute, then 5 minutes, then 30 minutes
6. **Eventually**: Succeeds on retry OR fails permanently after 3 attempts

## Monitor for Issues

Run this daily to catch problems:

```sql
-- Find purchases that need attention
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN status = 'pending' AND created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour' 
            THEN '‚ö†Ô∏è STUCK PENDING'
        WHEN status = 'failed' 
            THEN '‚ùå FAILED'
        ELSE '‚úÖ OK'
    END as alert,
    id,
    email,
    credits,
    status,
    created_at,
    metadata->>'last_error' as error
FROM credit_purchase
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
    AND status IN ('pending', 'failed')
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Need Help?

If credits STILL don't sync after following all steps:

1. Run `investigate-current-issue.sql` and share the output
2. Check Supabase function logs (Dashboard ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí stripeWebhook ‚Üí Logs)
3. Check Stripe webhook logs (Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Webhooks)
4. Run the test purchase query above and share results
