-- SECURE approach: Enable RLS with proper policies for property_contributors
-- This allows the trigger to work while maintaining security

-- 1. Re-enable RLS
ALTER TABLE property_contributors ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE contributor_payouts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE revenue_distribution ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 2. Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own contributions" ON property_contributors;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can insert contributions" ON property_contributors;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can update contributions" ON property_contributors;

-- 3. Create secure policies that allow both user access AND trigger operations

-- Allow users to view their own contribution stats
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own contributions" ON property_contributors
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- CRITICAL: Allow INSERT for triggers (but only for valid rating submissions)
-- This policy allows inserts when the user_id matches the authenticated user
CREATE POLICY "Allow trigger inserts for authenticated users" ON property_contributors
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- CRITICAL: Allow UPDATE for triggers (but only for the user's own records)
CREATE POLICY "Allow trigger updates for authenticated users" ON property_contributors
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
    WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- 4. Similar policies for other tables
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own payouts" ON contributor_payouts
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "System can create payouts" ON contributor_payouts
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true); -- Payouts are created by admin functions

-- 5. Revenue distribution (admin only)
CREATE POLICY "Users can view revenue for their contributions" ON revenue_distribution
    FOR SELECT USING (
        EXISTS(
            SELECT 1 FROM property_contributors pc 
            WHERE pc.property_id = revenue_distribution.property_id 
            AND pc.user_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );

-- 6. Verify the policies work
SELECT 
    'Security Status:' as check_type,
    tablename,
    rowsecurity as rls_enabled,
    CASE 
        WHEN rowsecurity THEN 'üîí SECURED with RLS'
        ELSE '‚ö†Ô∏è UNSECURED (RLS disabled)'
    END as status
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN ('property_contributors', 'contributor_payouts', 'revenue_distribution')
ORDER BY tablename;

-- 7. Test that policies allow the expected operations
SELECT 
    '‚úÖ RLS re-enabled with secure policies!' as message,
    'Triggers can still work, but direct manipulation is prevented' as security_benefit;
