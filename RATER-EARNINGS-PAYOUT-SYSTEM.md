# 💰 Rater Earnings & Payout System - Complete Guide

## 📋 Executive Summary

Your app has a **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** revenue sharing and payout system! Here's what happens:

### 1️⃣ **When Someone Rates a Property**
- The system automatically tracks who rated what and how many times
- Stats are stored in the `property_contributors` table

### 2️⃣ **When Someone Buys a Report**
- Revenue is split: **80% platform, 10% top contributor, 10% other contributors**
- **Top Contributor** = person with most ratings for that property in past 30 days
- The system creates **pending payout** records for each contributor
- Payouts are proportional to contribution (more ratings = bigger share)

### 3️⃣ **When Raters Want Their Money**
- They open the **Earnings Screen** in the app
- Click **"🔗 Stripe Connection"** to set up their bank account via **Stripe Express**
- Complete a lightweight onboarding form (handled by Stripe)
- Once verified, click **"💰 Request Payout"** to transfer earnings to their bank

## 🔧 What Needs to Be Completed

### Deploy the Production Payout Function

The `processPayouts` function currently runs in **TEST MODE**. I've created a production-ready version at:
```
supabase/functions/processPayouts/index-production.ts
```

**To deploy it:**

```bash
# Option 1: Replace the existing index.ts
cp supabase/functions/processPayouts/index-production.ts supabase/functions/processPayouts/index.ts

# Option 2: Deploy directly
supabase functions deploy processPayouts --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
```

---

## 🚀 Complete Setup Steps

### 1. Run Database Migrations

Run these SQL files in your Supabase SQL Editor (in order):

```sql
-- 1. Revenue sharing schema
\i revenue-sharing-schema-safe.sql

-- 2. Stripe Connect tables and functions
\i stripe-connect-migration-safe.sql
```

### 2. Deploy Edge Functions

```bash
# Deploy Stripe Connect account creation
supabase functions deploy createStripeConnectAccount --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

# Deploy payout processing (production version)
supabase functions deploy processPayouts --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
```

### 3. Set Stripe Environment Variables

In **Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → Secrets**, add:

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret
SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### 4. Enable Stripe Connect

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard → Connect Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect)
2. Enable **Stripe Connect** for your account
3. Set up **Express accounts** (lightweight onboarding for payees)
4. Configure branding (optional but recommended)

---

## 💡 How It Works (End-to-End)

### For Raters:

1. **Rate Properties** 📝
   - Rate noise, safety, cleanliness for properties
   - Stats automatically tracked in background

2. **Earn Money** 💰
   - When someone buys a report for a property they rated
   - System creates pending payout automatically
   - They see earnings in the Earnings screen

3. **Connect Bank Account** 🏦
   - Tap "🔗 Stripe Connection" button
   - Redirected to Stripe Express onboarding
   - Fill out lightweight form (name, bank account, tax info)
   - Stripe verifies information (1-2 business days)

4. **Request Payout** 💸
   - Once bank connected and verified
   - Tap "💰 Request Payout" button
   - Money transferred to their bank account via Stripe Transfer
   - Usually arrives in 1-2 business days

### For You (Platform):

1. **Revenue Automatically Distributed**
   - When webhook receives payment confirmation
   - System calculates and creates payout records
   - No manual intervention needed

2. **Minimal Compliance Burden**
   - Stripe handles KYC (Know Your Customer)
   - Stripe issues 1099s (if required)
   - Stripe handles tax reporting
   - You just facilitate the platform

## 💸 Revenue Split Example

### Scenario:
- Property report sells for **$10.00**
- **Alice** has rated it 15 times (top contributor)
- **Bob** has rated it 10 times
- **Carol** has rated it 5 times

### Distribution:
```
Platform:          $8.00  (80%)
Alice (Top):       $1.00  (10%)
Bob + Carol:       $1.00  (10% split proportionally)
  - Bob:           $0.67  (10 / 15 = 66.7% of $1.00)
  - Carol:         $0.33  (5 / 15 = 33.3% of $1.00)
```

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Test Stripe Connect (Sandbox)

1. In Stripe **Test Mode**, use test bank account:
   - Routing: `110000000`
   - Account: `000123456789`

2. Create test account:
   ```javascript
   // In your app, as a rater
   // 1. Go to Earnings screen
   // 2. Click "Stripe Connection"
   // 3. Use test SSN: 000-00-0000
   // 4. Use test bank info above
   ```

3. Simulate payouts:
   ```bash
   # Call the processPayouts function
   curl -X POST https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/processPayouts \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_USER_JWT" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
   ```

## 📊 Admin Monitoring

### Check Pending Payouts
```sql
SELECT 
  cp.id,
  u.email,
  cp.payout_amount,
  cp.status,
  cp.created_at
FROM contributor_payouts cp
JOIN auth.users u ON cp.user_id = u.id
WHERE cp.status = 'pending'
ORDER BY cp.created_at DESC;
```

### Check Total Platform Revenue
```sql
SELECT 
  SUM(platform_share) as total_platform_revenue,
  SUM(top_contributor_share + other_contributors_share) as total_rater_payouts
FROM revenue_distribution;
```

### Check Stripe Account Status
```sql
SELECT 
  u.email,
  usa.stripe_account_id,
  usa.account_status,
  usa.payouts_enabled,
  usa.created_at
FROM user_stripe_accounts usa
JOIN auth.users u ON usa.user_id = u.id
ORDER BY usa.created_at DESC;
```
