# üè† Help Test Our Property Rating App!

## What is it?
We've built a mobile app that lets you rate residential properties based on noise levels, safety, and cleanliness. Think "Yelp for neighborhoods" - but you have to actually be near the property to leave a rating!

## Why we need your help
We need real people to test the app and give us honest feedback before we launch publicly. Your input will directly shape the final product!

## What's in it for you?
- ‚úÖ **Free access** to all premium features during testing
- ‚úÖ **Free property reports** (normally $X each)
- ‚úÖ **Early adopter status** when we launch
