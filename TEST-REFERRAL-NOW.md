# ✅ Test Your Referral Link Now!

## Quick Test Steps

### 1. **Test the Referral Page**

Open this link in your browser:
```
https://leadsong.com/referral/D0A25789
```

You should now see:
- ✅ A beautiful purple gradient page
- ✅ The referral code "D0A25789" displayed prominently
- ✅ App features listed
- ✅ Download buttons for iOS and Android
- ❌ NOT "Page Not Found"

### 2. **Test from Your Mobile App**

1. Open your Leadsong app
2. Go to the **Rewards tab**
3. Tap **"Share with Friends"**
4. Share the link (to yourself or a test account)
5. Click the link
6. Verify the landing page loads correctly

### 3. **Verify No More Duplicate Links**

When you share from the app, you should see:
```
Join me on Leadsong! Use my referral code D0A25789 to get started.

https://leadsong.com/referral/D0A25789
```

**NOT:**
```
Join me on Leadsong! Use my referral code D0A25789 to get started.

https://leadsong.com/referral/D0A25789
https://leadsong.com/referral/D0A25789  ❌ (duplicate)
```

## If It's Working ✅

Congratulations! Your referral system is now live! 🎉

**Next steps:**
1. Update app store links in `website/lib/appStoreLinks.ts` when apps are published
2. Share the referral feature with your users
3. (Optional) Implement referral tracking - see `REFERRAL-SYSTEM-SETUP.md`

## If It's NOT Working ❌

### Still seeing "Page Not Found"?

**Possible reasons:**
1. **Deployment cache** - Wait 2-5 minutes and try again
2. **DNS propagation** - Can take up to 24 hours (usually instant)
3. **Deployment failed** - Check your hosting platform dashboard for errors

**Quick checks:**
```bash
# Check if website folder was deployed
# Look for these files on your hosting dashboard:
- website/app/referral/[code]/page.tsx ✅
- website/lib/appStoreLinks.ts ✅
```

### Still seeing duplicate links?

**Possible reasons:**
1. **App not rebuilt** - Need to rebuild the mobile app with the updated RewardsScreen.tsx
2. **Cache** - Close and reopen the app completely

**Solution:**
```bash
# Rebuild the mobile app
npm start
# Then test again on your device
```

## What Was Fixed

✅ **Duplicate links** - Fixed in `src/screens/RewardsScreen.tsx`
✅ **Landing page** - Created at `website/app/referral/[code]/page.tsx`
✅ **App store buttons** - Ready (just need URL updates)
✅ **Mobile responsive** - Works on all devices
