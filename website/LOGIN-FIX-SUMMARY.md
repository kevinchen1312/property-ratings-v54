# Login Issue Fix Summary

## Problem
When users clicked "Sign In" on credits.leadsong.com, the form would clear and the screen would blink, but nothing would happen - no error message, no redirect.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Missing Environment Variables
The most common cause is missing or incorrectly configured environment variables. If `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are not set, the Supabase client fails silently.

### 2. Poor Error Handling
Errors were not being displayed prominently, making it look like the form just reset without explanation.

### 3. Session Cookie Timing Issues
There was a race condition where the redirect happened before session cookies were fully propagated.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling (`website/app/auth/page.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Added environment variable validation
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive console logging (watch browser console for üîê üîë ‚úÖ ‚ùå messages)
- ‚úÖ Added visual error messages when env vars are missing
- ‚úÖ Improved error message display for authentication failures
- ‚úÖ Added retry logic for session establishment (up to 10 attempts)
- ‚úÖ Increased delay before redirect to ensure cookies are set (500ms)

### 2. Fixed Auth Callback (`website/app/auth/callback/route.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Properly set cookies on response object during OAuth flow
- ‚úÖ Ensures session cookies are sent to client

### 3. Improved Middleware (`website/middleware.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Better cookie handling during token refresh
- ‚úÖ Added comments explaining the flow

### 4. Added Diagnostic Tools
- ‚úÖ Created `check-env.js` - Run this to verify environment setup
- ‚úÖ Created `.env.local.example` - Template for environment variables
- ‚úÖ Created `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- ‚úÖ Updated `README.md` - Added troubleshooting section

## How to Fix Your Installation

### Step 1: Check Environment Variables

```bash
cd website
node check-env.js
```

This will tell you if your environment variables are missing or incorrectly set.

### Step 2: Create/Update .env.local

If you don't have a `.env.local` file:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Then edit `.env.local` and fill in your actual credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...your-actual-key...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...your-actual-key...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
```

**Where to find your Supabase credentials:**
1. Go to https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí API
4. Copy the URL and keys

### Step 3: Restart Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test Login with Browser Console Open

1. Open your browser DevTools (F12 or right-click ‚Üí Inspect)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/auth
4. Enter your email and password
5. Click "Sign In"
6. Watch the console for log messages:
   - üîê Auth form submitted
   - üîë Attempting sign in...
   - ‚úÖ Sign in successful
   - üîÑ Session check attempts
   - ‚úÖ Session established
   - ‚úÖ Redirecting to /credits

If you see any ‚ùå errors, they will tell you exactly what went wrong.

### Step 5: Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Missing Supabase environment variables" | Set up `.env.local` (see Step 2) |
| "Invalid login credentials" | Check username/password, or create new account |
| "Email not confirmed" | Check your email for verification link |
| "Session not established" | Clear cookies, try incognito mode |
| Form just clears with no logs | Check that dev server restarted after .env.local changes |

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables are set (`node check-env.js` passes)
- [ ] Development server is running (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Browser console is open (F12 ‚Üí Console)
- [ ] You can see log messages when clicking Sign In
- [ ] Errors are displayed on screen if authentication fails

   # Clear browser cookies and cache
   # Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)
   rm -rf .next
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Try Creating a New Account Instead**
