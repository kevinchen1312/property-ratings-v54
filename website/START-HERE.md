## 🔧 Before You Start

You'll need:

- [ ] Node.js 18+
- [ ] A Supabase project (URL + keys)
- [ ] A Stripe account (test keys)
- [ ] Stripe CLI (`brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe`)

Don't have these? No problem! [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md) walks you through it.

## 📱 Mobile App Flow

```
1. User taps "Buy Credits" in app
2. App opens: https://leadsong.com/credits
3. User selects package → redirected to Stripe
4. User pays → redirected back to app via deep link
5. Webhook adds credits to database
6. App refreshes balance → user sees new credits
```

## 🎨 UI Preview

The website features a beautiful purple gradient design matching your app, with:

- Current balance display
- 4 credit package cards (1, 5, 10, 25)
- "Most Popular" badge
- Savings indicators
- Responsive mobile design
- "How it works" section

## 🔒 Security Highlights

- ✅ Webhook signature verification (prevents fake webhooks)
- ✅ Server-side authentication (no client-side trust)
- ✅ Service role key never exposed to browser
- ✅ Idempotent processing (duplicate webhooks handled safely)
- ✅ Row Level Security on database
- ✅ HTTPS enforced in production

## 🧪 Quick Test

```bash
# Test card (Stripe test mode)
4242 4242 4242 4242
Expiry: 12/30
CVC: 123
ZIP: 12345

# Watch webhook logs in Terminal 1
# Check database: Supabase → credit_ledger
```

**🔜 You Need To:**

3. Create Stripe products and add Price IDs
4. Run database migration
5. Test locally
6. Deploy to production

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use 2 terminals**: One for webhook listener, one for dev server
2. **Check webhook logs**: They show you exactly what's happening
3. **Test idempotency**: Try replaying a webhook to verify credits aren't added twice
4. **Mobile testing**: Use actual device for deep link testing
5. **Keep docs open**: Refer to QUICK-REFERENCE.md while developing

## 🐛 Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Missing signature" | Check `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env.local` |
| Webhook not firing | Ensure Stripe CLI is running |
| Credits not updating | Check webhook logs and database |
| Can't access page | Ensure you're signed in via Supabase |
