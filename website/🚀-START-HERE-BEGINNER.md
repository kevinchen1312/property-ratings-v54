## Your Learning Path (2-3 hours total)

### Step 1: Understand What You're Building (5 minutes)
**Read this section right now:**

You're creating a website where users can buy credits with their credit card. When they buy:
1. They pay on Stripe (secure payment page)
2. Money goes to your bank account
3. Credits automatically appear in their app
4. They return to your mobile app

Think of it like a vending machine: money in → credits out.

**That's it!** Not so scary, right?
