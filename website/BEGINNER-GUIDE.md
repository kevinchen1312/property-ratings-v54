# Complete Beginner's Guide to Setting Up Leadsong Credits

**Welcome!** This guide assumes you've never built a website before. I'll walk you through everything step by step, explaining what each thing means and why we're doing it.

**Time needed:** About 1-2 hours (including account setup)

---

## üìã What You're Building

You're setting up a website where users can buy credits using their credit card. When someone buys credits:
1. They pay on a secure Stripe payment page
2. The money goes to your Stripe account
3. Credits automatically appear in their app account
4. They return to your mobile app

Think of it like an online store, but just for credits.

## Part 1: Get the Required Accounts (30 minutes)

You need 3 free accounts. Let's set them up one by one.

### Step 1.1: Get a Supabase Account (10 min)

**What is Supabase?** It's a free database service. Think of it as an Excel spreadsheet in the cloud that stores user data.

1. **Go to** [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. **Click** "Start your project" (green button, top right)
3. **Sign up** with your GitHub account (or create one first at github.com)
4. **Create a new project:**
   - Click "New project"
   - Name: `leadsong-credits` (or any name you want)
   - Database Password: Create a strong password (SAVE THIS!)
   - Region: Choose closest to you
   - Plan: Free (this is fine for starting)
   - Click "Create new project"
5. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for it to set up

**‚úÖ Done!** Keep this tab open, you'll need it later.

---

### Step 1.2: Get a Stripe Account (10 min)

**What is Stripe?** It processes credit card payments securely. Like a cash register for your website.

1. **Go to** [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. **Click** "Start now" or "Sign up"
3. **Fill in your details:**
   - Email
   - Password
   - Country
4. **Skip the business details for now** (you can fill them later)
5. **Important:** Make sure you're in **Test mode** (there's a toggle switch that says "Test mode" - it should be ON)
   - Test mode = fake money, safe for testing
   - Live mode = real money (we'll switch to this later)

**‚úÖ Done!** Keep this tab open too.

---

### Step 1.3: Install Node.js (10 min)

**What is Node.js?** It's software that lets your computer run the website code.

1. **Go to** [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. **Download** the version that says "LTS" (recommended)
   - Windows: Download the .msi file
   - Mac: Download the .pkg file
3. **Run the installer**
   - Click through the setup (all defaults are fine)
   - On Windows: Check "Automatically install necessary tools"
4. **Verify it worked:**
   - **Windows:** Press `Windows key + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter
   - **Mac:** Press `Command + Space`, type `terminal`, press Enter
   - Type: `node --version` and press Enter
   - You should see something like `v20.10.0` (the number might be different)
   - If you see "command not found", restart your computer and try again

**‚úÖ Done!** Close the terminal/command prompt for now.

---

### Step 1.4: Install Stripe CLI (10 min)

**What is Stripe CLI?** It's a tool that lets Stripe talk to your local computer during testing.

**For Windows:**
1. **Go to** [github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases/latest)
2. **Download** `stripe_X.X.X_windows_x86_64.zip` (X.X.X is the version number)
3. **Extract the zip file** (right-click ‚Üí Extract All)
4. **Move `stripe.exe` to** `C:\Windows\System32\`
   - You might need to click "Continue" to give permission
5. **Test it:**
   - Open Command Prompt (Windows key + R, type `cmd`)
   - Type: `stripe --version`
   - Should show a version number

**For Mac:**
1. **Open Terminal** (Command + Space, type "terminal")
2. **Install Homebrew first** (if you don't have it):
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
   - This takes 5-10 minutes
3. **Install Stripe CLI:**
   ```bash
   brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
   ```
4. **Test it:**
   ```bash
   stripe --version
   ```

**If you get stuck:** That's okay! You can do this step later. Skip to Part 2 for now.

**‚úÖ Done!** Keep the terminal/command prompt open.

---

## Part 2: Download and Set Up the Website Code (15 minutes)

### Step 2.1: Find the Code (2 min)

The code is already on your computer! It's in:
```
C:\Users\ucric\leadsong v2.5\property-ratings-v54\website\
```

**To find it easily:**
1. **Open File Explorer** (Windows key + E)
2. **Navigate to:** This PC ‚Üí Users ‚Üí ucric ‚Üí leadsong v2.5 ‚Üí property-ratings-v54 ‚Üí website
3. You should see folders like `app`, `components`, `lib`, and files like `package.json`

**‚úÖ Found it!**

---

### Step 2.2: Open the Folder in a Terminal (3 min)

**Windows:**
1. In File Explorer, with the `website` folder open
2. Click in the **address bar** (where it shows the path)
3. Type `cmd` and press Enter
4. A black window (Command Prompt) will open

**Mac:**
1. Open Terminal
2. Type `cd ` (that's cd + space)
3. Drag the `website` folder from Finder into the Terminal window
4. Press Enter

You should now see something like:

C:\Users\ucric\leadsong v2.5\property-ratings-v54\website>
```

**‚úÖ Done!** Keep this window open.

---

### Step 2.3: Install Website Dependencies (10 min)

**What are dependencies?** They're pre-built pieces of code that your website needs to work. Like buying ingredients before cooking.

1. **In the terminal, type:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Press Enter**
3. **Wait** - You'll see a lot of text scrolling by. This is normal!
4. **This takes 5-10 minutes** depending on your internet speed
5. **When done**, you'll see your prompt again (the `C:\...>` line)

**If you see warnings (yellow text):** That's okay, ignore them.

**If you see errors (red text):** 
- Make sure you're in the right folder (it should have `package.json`)
- Make sure Node.js is installed correctly (`node --version`)

**‚úÖ Done!** Now you have all the code pieces needed.

   ```
   > Ready! Your webhook signing secret is whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

6. **Copy that `whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxx` part**

7. **Go back to your `.env.local` file:**
   - Find the line: `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx`
   - Replace `whsec_xxxxx` with the real secret you just copied
   - Save the file

**‚úÖ Keep this terminal window open!** It needs to stay running.

---

### Step 6.2: Start the Website (5 min)

1. **Go back to your FIRST terminal** (the one you used for `npm install`)
2. **Type:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Press Enter**
4. **Wait** - you'll see text appear, then:
   ```
   ‚ñ≤ Next.js 14.x.x
   - Local:        http://localhost:3000
   - Ready in X.Xs
   ```

6. **Click** "Create user"
7. **You'll see your new user** in the list
8. **Copy the User ID** (long text like `123e4567-e89b-12d3...`)

**Now create a profile for this user:**
1. **Click** "SQL Editor" (left sidebar)
2. **Click** "New query"
3. **Paste this** (replace YOUR-USER-ID with the ID you copied):
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO profiles (id, credits)
   VALUES ('YOUR-USER-ID-HERE', 0);
   ```
4. **Click** "Run"
5. **Should say** "Success. 1 rows"

**‚úÖ Test user created!**

### Step 6.4: Test a Purchase! (5 min)

üéâ Time to see it work!

1. **Open your browser**
2. **Go to:** `http://localhost:3000/credits`
3. **You'll see** a purple page asking you to sign in

**Sign in:**
1. **Go to:** `http://localhost:3000/auth` (you might need to create this page - see note below)
2. **OR manually sign in** through Supabase:
   - Actually, let me give you an easier way...

**Easier way - Use Supabase test:**
1. **In your terminal** (stop the server first with Ctrl+C)
2. **Install Supabase Auth UI:**
   ```bash
   npm install @supabase/auth-ui-react @supabase/auth-ui-shared
   ```
3. **I'll create a sign-in page for you...**

Actually, let me create that auth page for you right now:

## Part 7: Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Command not found" errors
- Make sure Node.js is installed
- Restart your terminal
- Restart your computer

### "Port already in use"
- Something else is using port 3000
- Stop it with: `npx kill-port 3000`
- Or change the port: `npm run dev -- -p 3001`

### Website won't load
- Make sure both terminals are running
- Check you're going to `localhost:3000` not just `localhost`
- Try `http://localhost:3000` (include the `http://`)

### Stripe webhook errors
- Make sure `.env.local` has the correct `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- Make sure the stripe listener terminal is still running

### Database errors
- Check you ran the migration SQL in Supabase
- Check your Supabase keys are correct in `.env.local`
