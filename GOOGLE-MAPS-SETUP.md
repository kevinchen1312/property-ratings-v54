# Google Maps Integration Setup

## ✅ Completed Changes

Your app has been successfully migrated from OpenStreetMap to Google Maps!

### What Was Changed:

1. **✅ App Configuration** (`app.config.ts`)
   - Added Google Maps API key configuration for Android and iOS
   - API key will be embedded in the native builds

2. **✅ Search Functionality** (`src/services/properties.ts`)
   - Replaced Nominatim (OSM) with Google Places Text Search API
   - Much better address coverage and accuracy
   - Searches now find "739 Switchyard Pl" and similar addresses

3. **✅ Proximity Loading** (`src/services/googlePlaces.ts`)
   - Replaced OSM Overpass API with Google Places Nearby Search
   - Loads properties within 75m radius using Google's comprehensive database
   - Automatically saves new properties to your database

4. **✅ Map Display** (`react-native-maps`)
   - react-native-maps already uses Google Maps by default on Android/iOS
   - No additional changes needed!

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Add Environment Variable

Create or update `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
# .env file
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyBZr1V5laBcjeoGFE0iafU73k6ebD1hza8
```

### Step 2: Rebuild Your App

Since we changed native configuration (API keys), you need to rebuild:

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)

# Clear cache and rebuild
npx expo start --clear

# When the QR code appears, press 'a' for Android or 'i' for iOS
```

**Important:** You may need to do a **full rebuild** the first time:
```bash
# For development build
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Or for local build
npx expo prebuild --clean
```

## 🧪 Testing

After rebuild, test these features:

### ✅ Search Test:
1. Search for: `739 switchyard place`
2. Should now find "739 Switchyard Pl, Indianapolis, IN" ✅
3. Should show accurate results with Google's database

### ✅ Proximity Loading Test:
1. Move around the map (or use mock location)
2. Properties within 75m should load automatically
3. Check console for: `🗺️ Found X properties from Google Places`

### ✅ Map Display Test:
1. Map should display Google Maps tiles (not OSM)
2. More detailed, accurate map
3. Better street names and labels

## 💰 Cost Estimate

With your current API key restrictions:
- **Free tier:** $200/month credit
- **Map loads:** ~$2 per 1,000 loads
- **Places searches:** ~$17 per 1,000 searches
- **Nearby searches:** ~$32 per 1,000 searches

**For 100 active users:**
- Map loads: ~10,000/month = ~$20/month
- Searches: ~3,000/month = ~$51/month
- Nearby: ~5,000/month = ~$160/month
- **Total: ~$231/month**

⚠️ **You'll exceed the free tier by ~$31/month**

### Cost Optimization Tips:
1. Cache properties aggressively in database (already doing this ✅)
2. Reduce nearby search radius from 75m to 50m
3. Add debouncing to search (already doing this ✅)
4. Only load nearby properties when user stops moving

## 🔒 Security Note

Your API key is currently hardcoded in the source files for development. For production:

1. **Use environment variables** (already configured)
2. **Add API key restrictions** in Google Cloud Console:
   - Restrict to your Android/iOS app bundle IDs
   - Limit to specific APIs only
3. **Monitor usage** in Google Cloud Console

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Map not loading?
- Check that you rebuilt the app after adding the API key
- Verify the API key in Google Cloud Console
- Check that Maps SDK for Android/iOS are enabled

### Search not working?
- Verify Places API is enabled
- Check console for error messages
- Test the API key with a simple HTTP request

### "API key not valid" error?
- Make sure you enabled all required APIs
- Wait 5-10 minutes after enabling APIs
- Check API key restrictions (should be "None" for dev)

## 📊 Monitoring

Monitor your API usage:
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Navigate to "APIs & Services" → "Dashboard"
3. View usage charts for each API
4. Set up billing alerts if needed
