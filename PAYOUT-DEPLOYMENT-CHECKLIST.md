## ðŸ“Š Monitoring After Launch

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Revenue Distribution**
```sql
-- Check total revenue split
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_distributions,
  SUM(platform_share) as platform_revenue,
  SUM(top_contributor_share + other_contributors_share) as rater_payouts
FROM revenue_distribution;
```

2. **Pending Payouts**
```sql
-- Check pending payouts
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as pending_count,
  SUM(payout_amount) as total_pending
FROM contributor_payouts
WHERE status = 'pending';
```

3. **Payout Success Rate**
```sql
-- Check payout success rate
SELECT 
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  SUM(payout_amount) as total_amount
FROM contributor_payouts
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY status;
```

4. **Stripe Account Status**
```sql
-- Check how many raters have connected accounts
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_accounts,
  SUM(CASE WHEN payouts_enabled THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as verified_accounts,
  SUM(CASE WHEN account_status = 'pending' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as pending_accounts
FROM user_stripe_accounts;
```

## ðŸ”§ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Stripe Connect not enabled"

### Issue: Payouts failing silently
**Solution:** Check Supabase Edge Function logs:
```bash
npx supabase functions logs processPayouts
```

### Issue: Revenue not being distributed
**Solution:** Check Stripe webhook is properly configured and receiving events:
- Go to Stripe Dashboard â†’ Developers â†’ Webhooks
